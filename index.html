PRESS
"This sunny and simple bakery is home to the flakiest croissants in town. Order yours en francais at the counter, pull up a stool by the door, and watch the locals wander in…"
The New York Times, August 26, 2007

“For steaming cafes au lait, luscious cakes and perhaps the best croissants this side of the Atlantic, head to Jerome Mantel’s charming patisserie. The Parisien’s sweet and savoury treats are baked on the premises each morning to mouthwatering perfection. Ah, la vie est bonne!”
-   The Journal of Porter Airlines, Fall/Winter 2006
